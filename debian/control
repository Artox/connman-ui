Description: A full-featured GTK-based tray icon UI for ConnMan
 It targets all WM/DM users but Gnome3 ones*. It works on any Linux WM/DM 
 which provides a freedesktop compliant system tray. (kde, awesome, ...)
 .
 It exposes almost all features provided by ConnMan API (small features are 
 missing, see TODO for more informations). You can enable/disable a technology 
 (wired, wifi, cellular, bt, ...), connect/disconnect a service, configure a 
 service (IPv4, IPv6, DNS, Timeservers, etc...), share your current connection 
 (tethering) and so on. Everything is accessible through the mouse via the 
 trayicon, all with left and right click.
